# Dog Party - Turing Mod1 - John Adams
 - Project 1 from Mod 1 of Turing Program. We received the project on Monday (our first day of the program) and we were given a week to complete the project. The project contained a visual comp and then iterations 0-4 containing specific functionality, responsiveness and extensions that the site should include. The project concluded in a functioning site built off a visual comp using HTML, CSS and
 JS.

## Motivation
  - I came into the first week of Mod1 at Turing with very little prior knowledge of coding as a whole let alone in HTML, CSS and JS. Outside of what we learned in the pre-mod - Mod 0 - I had taken a few online classes over the years, but nothing that really stuck.
  - My goal within this project was to complete all iterations given to us, some of which went beyond what we were learning in class that week. I accomplished that goal and successfully completed each iteration and ended with a responsive and functioning site that closely resembled the visual comp provided.
  - I wanted to use this project as a way to set myself up for the rest of this module and get into the flow of daily work and time management.

## iterations
  1. Build out HTML and CSS using the Turing Styling Guides as reference. Recreate the comp provided to be as visual similar as possible using well structured HTML and CSS.
   - Successfully recreated the visual comp with a high level of accuracy using HTML and CSS. Comp Image:

  2. Add some fuctionality via Javascript. Add an interaction where the user can type their dog's name into the input field and then by clicking the button the text in the input field takes the place of the text `Some Dogs`.

  3. Make the site responsive to be used with mobile devices without any provided layouts or formatting techniques - using basic HTML/CSS. With the use of media queries have the site respond to certain screen sizes. Media queries and formatting for mobile is not something we discussed during this week of the program.

  4. Adding Extensions and further functionality via Javascript.
    1. Adding functionality to each of the buttons in the three dog columns. When the button is clicked it should hide the text and then when clicked again it should unhide the text. Bonus: add an animation.
      -
    2. Add a tooltip to each of the elements in the nav bar. When hovering over the link a tooltip should appear giving more info about where the link goes.
      -
    3. Add a form containing input, textarea and button to bottom of the page so that it can update the text in each dog column paragraph. The input should be either a dropdown or radio/checkboxes to specify which column's text should be replaced
